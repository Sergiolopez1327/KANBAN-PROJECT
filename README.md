## Software Requirement Specifications


## Scrum update @ 16th February
For the first week meeting, we get to know about each other as well as the project concept and requirements. During the meeting, we decided that I (Sergio) will be the scrum master, Quang will help on creating the flow chart diagram, while Anthony and Elton will work on creating the GitHub repository. Next step, we planning on coming up with the basic framework of the software and begin looking at similar projects on GitHub 



## Change after discussion
