### Scrum update @ 16th February
For the first week meeting, we get to know about each other as well as the project concept and requirements. During the meeting, we decided that I (Sergio) will be the scrum master, Quang will help on creating the flow chart diagram, while Anthony and Elton will work on creating the GitHub repository. Next step, we planning on coming up with the basic framework of the software and begin looking at similar projects on GitHub. 

## Group project flow-chart

The website will follow the basic process of a task management application. Users will have the ability to create tasks, as well as modify and delete the task of their work along the process. Each action will be update and store in the online ope scorce database.
